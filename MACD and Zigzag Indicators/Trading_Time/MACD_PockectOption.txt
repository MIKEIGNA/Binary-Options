and the deal was Clos in plus guys and the deal is closing in plus guys hello dear traders in today's video I refuted the trading strategy with the macd indicator one of the videos on the YouTube which has already received more than 2 and a half million views and everyone continues to trade using this strategy and this is extremely wrong and now I will say why let's go guys now we are already on the pocket option my balance so we have uh $6,000 time frame 30 seconds below the indicator macd the BET of 100 bucks we open the first
currency pair open for Decline and I will immediately analyze the indicator we see two red moving average prevails both are directed down to the bars also red bars overcome the zero Mark in the bottom position so the indicator MD completely tells us about opening a downside trade where we open in this case until the end of the transactions there are 6 seconds left uh as I said before this strategy is not working guys so we see the first trade goes into the minus and our balance decreases by as uh much as 100
bucks and is 5,900 bucks on our balance sheet we trade as always on pocket options so don't forget this is our main platform but we have already moved to the next currency pair we open trade for increase here and immediately again move on to our analysis of the indicator here we have the last range of uh three green bars we see a moving change in progress so if we take a closer look specifically in this case don't confuse the upward Trend and um in connection with this we open the deal for an increase and the
second deal is already uh in the negative for us guys um that's the whole strategy but we don't stop there now we're moving on to the S currency pair where will confirm that this strategy is I remind you of the YouTube uh video from this strategy which has collected more than 2.
5 million viewers and people continue to trade using this strategy which is very very very bad guys don't do this here we open the trade to reduce the last bar we have red one the moving average is also red begins to overcome the green one now I drawing uh it for you an example of how it's happening so we see that we're slowly moving into a uh downward downtrend we see that the picture has already changed in our chart we see how the colors of the macd indicator change in front of you and again the deal goes away for us in minus dear Traders this is what we had I

along macd as well two green bars already by the way three green bars so until the end of the deal 3 seconds and the deal was closed in plus guys youth is a comparison congratulations to those who are in my telegram Channel because they are also closed the deal in plus and earned money because I repeat I duplicate these deals in my TG so hurry up and move on here we are again on the first currency pair open a trade here for an increase and start the analysis so dear Traders please remember how to trade correctly
with the macd indicator so what what we see here we have two areas of support here and most likely from the first just like that we will have a reversal in the upper position so along the macd also three green bars plus the green line changing its direction from relatively red so excellent guys excellent the deal closed in a plus the profit is quite large since we need to bid of the minus of um which strategies we tested so all this is in front of you without cuts without splicing so live to show the authentity of this video and I will
slowly move on to the next currency pair we still have three currency pairs ahead to prove that my strategy that I'm testing with you is completely working so it's not a in this case we have opened the trade to increase again we will immediately see the support area area we have reached it and in most cases there will be a reversal from it so since this is the second achievement of the area we see a reversal of the up Trend taking place we also have green bars and two moving ones are directed to the upper position
where we opened our trade so we see there is a quite strong growth and the deal is closing in plus guys uh we see my strategy is completely working there are even more private strategies in my TG channel so please don't forget about it guys let's move on to the thir currency pair on the thir currency pair we see a large number number of green parts are going up the green moving average also overom the red moving average which is very important and the general Trend uh of the last period is going up I'll highlight the area of resistance
and we'll have this movement right towards this area so wait for 3 seconds left and great guys great super this deal is great and also again closes and profit dear Traders well everything is working before your eyes so I repeat the video without cards without anything you will see the balance too and we go to the last currency pair to consolidate our success we open a trade to redu the amount I remind you of 15 bucks 30 seconds here everything points to a decline like the overall balance and macd we see the last bar is red
according to moving average it's not yet shown very correctly but according to zigzag we also have a downtrend the resistance level we haven't reached the reversal happened much earlier so let's wait for the deal to close uh 2 seconds left two one excellent guys our deal is closed in plus again one more time so great situation and this is where our issue comes to an end I tested two strategies in front of you the first one which reached received on YouTube two and a half million views and many unfortunately trade on it and the second
